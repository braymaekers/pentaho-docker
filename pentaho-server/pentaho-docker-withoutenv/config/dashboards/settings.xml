    Intentionally commented out. 
    This causes the server to pick the default for the platform
    (either create-screenshot.sh or create-screenshot.bat)
    The reason that this is a setting rather than hard-wired is that on some platforms it can be rather tricky
    to get the swt browser to work.
    For these cases, the user might want to configure their own script.
    Note that the command must be a script.
    For windows the script is executed via the cmd executable, for *nix the script is executed using sh.
    Scripts are assumed to reside in the dashboards/shell directory.

   Possible swt browsers.
   Note that not all types maybe present in all swt versions. 
   As far as we know, swt 3.6 has no support for explicit browser versions.
   As of swt 3.7 MOZILLA and WEBKIT are valid options.
   DEFAULT or NONE allows swt to pick the default browser for the platform.
